The binaries are not stored in **tomato**, because they relatively big and it would take too much space to store them in the repository including the versions introduced in each modification. Instead the binaries are provided within the releases of the relevant packages. The binaries are downloaded to this folder during the installation process of tomato.

Please refer to [config/binaries.cfg](https://github.com/sertansenturk/tomato/blob/master/config/binaries.cfg) for these releases.
