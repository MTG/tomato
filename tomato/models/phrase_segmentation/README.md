# Precomputed training models for automatic phrase segmentation on makam music scores

The model is computed using the [makam-symbolic-phrase-segmentation]](https://github.com/MTG/makam-symbolic-phrase-segmentation) repository. 

The training data is obtained from [makam-symbolic-phrase-segmentation-dataset](https://github.com/MTG/makam-symbolic-phrase-segmentation-dataset). We use Expert 1 which has annotated all the scores done by the other two and reported as the most reliable.
